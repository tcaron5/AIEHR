      "These studies were likely performed to evaluate the patient's symptoms, particularly those related to the left lower extremity cellulitis and potential deep venous thrombosis. The chest X-ray was also performed to assess cardiovascular status and potential lung disease.\n",
      "Answer: 10 As an internal medicine physician reviewing this patient's electronic health record, I would identify the following pertinent positives and negatives:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Positives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **WBC 12.5**: The elevated white blood cell count suggests that the patient has a significant inflammatory response, which is consistent with the diagnosis of LLE cellulitis.\n",
      "2. **Mild cardiomegaly on CXR**: While mild cardiomegaly may not be a primary concern in this patient's presentation, it does suggest that there may be some cardiac involvement or compromise.\n",
      "3. **No evidence of DVT on US**: The lack of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on ultrasound examination reduces the likelihood of pulmonary embolism as a significant contributor to the patient's symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Negatives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Diabetes, steroid-induced**: This condition may be contributing to the patient's cellulitis and potentially compromising wound healing.\n",
      "2. **HLD**: Hyperlipidemia could contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, which may be exacerbating the patient's cardiomegaly.\n",
      "3. **Cholelithiasis**: The presence of gallstones may not directly impact the patient's symptoms, but it could potentially lead to biliary colic or cholecystitis if left untreated.\n",
      "4. **LLE cellulitis with limited improvement on antibiotics**: The patient's cellulitis has not responded adequately to antibiotic treatment, which raises concerns about potential complications such as sepsis or abscess formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Uncertainties:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Bullous pemphigoid**: While the patient reports a history of bullous pemphigoid, there is no clinic or laboratory evidence to support this diagnosis. Further evaluation may be necessary to clarify this diagnosis.\n",
      "2. **Unclear relationship between COPD and LLE cellulitis**: The connection between the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and LLE cellulitis is not clear. Further inquiry into the patient's smoking history, airflow limitation, and potential exacerbation of COPD by the cellulitis may be necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the pertinent positives relate to the patient's inflammatory response, cardiac status, and lack of DVT. The negatives include potential contributors to the patient's symptoms such as diabetes, HLD, cholelithiasis, and LLE cellulitis that has not responded adequately to antibiotic treatment.\n",
      "Answer: 11 Based on the electronic health record, I did not find any blood culture or microbiology studies reported. However, the patient was given Duonebs and CTX 1g IV for left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis, which suggests that a diagnosis of bacterial infection was made based on clinical presentation and possibly some imaging findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pertinent results section does mention laboratory values, including WBC of 12.5, but it does not report any blood culture or microbiology results. Therefore, I cannot provide information on whether the patient's blood cultures grew anything or what organism was identified, nor can I report on antibiotic sensitivity testing.\n",
      "Answer: 12 Based on the patient's electronic health record (EHR), I will provide a review of the case and suggest a differential diagnosis and recommended diagnostic workup.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chief Complaint:** LLE cellulitis\n",
      "\n",
      "**Presenting Symptoms:** WBC 12.5, mild cardiomegaly on CXR, mild vascular congestion, significant erythema and warmth on the left leg (LLE) with one bullous lesion and one ulcerated area.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cellulitis**: Given the patient's history of LLE cellulitis, it is possible that this is a recurrent episode. The presence of mild cardiomegaly on CXR and mild vascular congestion suggests that the infection may have spread to the surrounding tissues.\n",
      "2. **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)**: Although the initial US did not show evidence of DVT, it is still possible that this patient has developed a DVT, particularly given their history of venous thromboembolism (VTE).\n",
      "3. **Aortic Aneurysm**: The patient's past medical history includes an aortic aneurysm, which could be causing symptoms related to compression or embolization.\n",
      "4. **Bullous Pemphigoid**: Although there is no clinic or laboratory evidence to support this diagnosis, the presence of bullous lesions on the LLE suggests that it should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommended Diagnostic Workup:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Repeat US and Doppler studies**: Given the patient's history of VTE, it would be important to repeat US and Doppler studies to rule out DVT.\n",
      "2. **CT or MRI scan**: A CT or MRI scan could help evaluate the aortic aneurysm and rule out other potential causes of symptoms such as compression or embolization.\n",
      "3. **Laboratory tests**: Further laboratory tests, such as blood cultures, would be important to determine if there is an underlying bacterial infection contributing to the patient's symptoms.\n",
      "4. **Clinical evaluation**: A thorough clinical evaluation, including a physical examination and assessment of the patient's mental status, would be necessary to further evaluate their overall condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Infection control measures**: Given the patient's history of cellulitis, it is essential to ensure proper infection control measures are in place to prevent further spread of the infection.\n",
      "2. **Cardiovascular evaluation**: The patient's mild cardiomegaly on CXR and mild vascular congestion suggest that a more comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation may be necessary to rule out underlying cardiac disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, based on the patient's presenting symptoms and past medical history, the differential diagnosis includes cellulitis, DVT, aortic aneurysm, and bullous pemphigoid. A thorough diagnostic workup, including repeat US and Doppler studies, CT or MRI scan, laboratory tests, and clinical evaluation, would be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.\n",
      "Answer: 13 Based on the electronic health record, I can see that the patient was given:\n",
      "\n",

      "**Positives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **WBC 12.5**: The elevated white blood cell count suggests that the patient has a significant inflammatory response, which is consistent with the diagnosis of LLE cellulitis.\n",
      "2. **Mild cardiomegaly on CXR**: While mild cardiomegaly may not be a primary concern in this patient's presentation, it does suggest that there may be some cardiac involvement or compromise.\n",
      "3. **No evidence of DVT on US**: The lack of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on ultrasound examination reduces the likelihood of pulmonary embolism as a significant contributor to the patient's symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Negatives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Diabetes, steroid-induced**: This condition may be contributing to the patient's cellulitis and potentially compromising wound healing.\n",
      "2. **HLD**: Hyperlipidemia could contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, which may be exacerbating the patient's cardiomegaly.\n",
      "3. **Cholelithiasis**: The presence of gallstones may not directly impact the patient's symptoms, but it could potentially lead to biliary colic or cholecystitis if left untreated.\n",
      "4. **LLE cellulitis with limited improvement on antibiotics**: The patient's cellulitis has not responded adequately to antibiotic treatment, which raises concerns about potential complications such as sepsis or abscess formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Uncertainties:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Bullous pemphigoid**: While the patient reports a history of bullous pemphigoid, there is no clinic or laboratory evidence to support this diagnosis. Further evaluation may be necessary to clarify this diagnosis.\n",
      "2. **Unclear relationship between COPD and LLE cellulitis**: The connection between the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and LLE cellulitis is not clear. Further inquiry into the patient's smoking history, airflow limitation, and potential exacerbation of COPD by the cellulitis may be necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the pertinent positives relate to the patient's inflammatory response, cardiac status, and lack of DVT. The negatives include potential contributors to the patient's symptoms such as diabetes, HLD, cholelithiasis, and LLE cellulitis that has not responded adequately to antibiotic treatment.\"\n",

      "**Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cellulitis**: Given the patient's history of LLE cellulitis, it is possible that this is a recurrent episode. The presence of mild cardiomegaly on CXR and mild vascular congestion suggests that the infection may have spread to the surrounding tissues.\n",
      "2. **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)**: Although the initial US did not show evidence of DVT, it is still possible that this patient has developed a DVT, particularly given their history of venous thromboembolism (VTE).\n",
      "3. **Aortic Aneurysm**: The patient's past medical history includes an aortic aneurysm, which could be causing symptoms related to compression or embolization.\n",
      "4. **Bullous Pemphigoid**: Although there is no clinic or laboratory evidence to support this diagnosis, the presence of bullous lesions on the LLE suggests that it should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommended Diagnostic Workup:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Repeat US and Doppler studies**: Given the patient's history of VTE, it would be important to repeat US and Doppler studies to rule out DVT.\n",
      "2. **CT or MRI scan**: A CT or MRI scan could help evaluate the aortic aneurysm and rule out other potential causes of symptoms such as compression or embolization.\n",
      "3. **Laboratory tests**: Further laboratory tests, such as blood cultures, would be important to determine if there is an underlying bacterial infection contributing to the patient's symptoms.\n",
      "4. **Clinical evaluation**: A thorough clinical evaluation, including a physical examination and assessment of the patient's mental status, would be necessary to further evaluate their overall condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Infection control measures**: Given the patient's history of cellulitis, it is essential to ensure proper infection control measures are in place to prevent further spread of the infection.\n",
      "2. **Cardiovascular evaluation**: The patient's mild cardiomegaly on CXR and mild vascular congestion suggest that a more comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation may be necessary to rule out underlying cardiac disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, based on the patient's presenting symptoms and past medical history, the differential diagnosis includes cellulitis, DVT, aortic aneurysm, and bullous pemphigoid.

      "1. Lab results: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 12.5, which may indicate an active infection.\n",
      "2. Imaging studies: The left leg ultrasound did not show evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and the chest X-ray revealed mild cardiomegaly and vascular congestion.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, hepatitis C, and other medical conditions that may impact their overall health.\n",

      "* Hepatitis C: a chronic viral infection that could potentially affect the liver and cause symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, or abdominal pain.\n",
      "* Diabetes, steroid-induced: a type of diabetes caused by the use of steroids, which can lead to high blood sugar levels and other complications.\n",
      "* Bullous pemphigoid (self-reported): an autoimmune blistering disease that may be related to the patient's skin symptoms in the LLE.\n",

      "\t+ General: Obese male, no acute distress (NAD), sitting up in bed, using his phone\n",
      "\t+ Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi\n",
      "\t+ Abdomen: Distended without fluid wave, nontender; Umbilical hernia present\n",
      "\t+ Lower Extremities (LLE): Significant erythema and warmth to the level of the midshin, with a bullous lesion noted on the left anterior leg; Right LLE (RLE) with much less erythema but chronic dermatitis; 2+ pitting edema to the level of the shin on the left and trace on the right\n",
