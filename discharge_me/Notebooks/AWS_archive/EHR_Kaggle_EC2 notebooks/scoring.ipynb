You were admitted due to a high fever, rapid heart rate, and low blood pressure, symptoms that were complicated by your ongoing treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma and other health conditions. During your stay, we conducted several important tests, including blood tests that showed a very low white blood cell count, indicating neutropenia, which can make you more susceptible to infections. We also identified episodes of rapid heartbeats through an EKG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your treatment included the administration of antibiotics, vancomycin and cefepime, to manage potential infections, and medications such as hydrocortisone and esmolol to stabilize your heart rate and blood pressure. We also adjusted your fluid intake and administered pressors to help manage your blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon discharge, please continue taking your prescribed medications as listed in your discharge summary. Notably, we have started you on Filgrastim to help boost your white blood cells, which you should take daily until your follow-up clinic visit. Please ensure to schedule a follow-up appointment with both the Bone Marrow Transplant team and your cardiologist to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment as necessary. There are no pending tests, but it's important to monitor your temperature and symptoms at home.\n",
