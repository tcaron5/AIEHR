    "\n",
    "You were admitted to the hospital due to significant swelling in your leg, which was causing pain and discomfort. The doctors were concerned about this swelling and wanted to make sure there were no serious issues causing it. They also noted that you had oral ulcers, abdominal swelling, and swollen lymph nodes, which were all part of the reason for your admission.\n",
    "\n",
    "During your stay, you underwent several tests to help the doctors understand what was causing your symptoms. These tests included an ultrasound of your leg to check for any blood clots, a chest X-ray to look at your heart and lungs, and an ultrasound of your abdomen to check for any fluid buildup. The results of these tests showed that there were no blood clots in your leg, but they did find some mild enlargement of your heart and signs of congestion in your blood vessels.\n",
    "\n",
    "To treat the swelling and pain in your leg, you were given Duonebs and CTX 1g IV for cellulitis. Cellulitis is an infection of the skin and soft tissues that can cause swelling and redness. The doctors believed this was the cause of your symptoms and wanted to treat it to help you feel better.\n",

    "In terms of changes to your medications, your prednisone dose was decreased to 15mg once daily, and you were discharged on clindamycin for the cellulitis. Clindamycin is an antibiotic that helps fight bacterial infections like cellulitis. It's important to take this medication as prescribed to ensure the infection clears up completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for follow-up care, it's essential to monitor your leg swelling and overall health closely. The doctors may want to see you for a follow-up appointment to check on your progress and make sure you're feeling better. If you have any concerns or notice any new symptoms, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider.\n",
