Patient noted in ED with mild troponin elevations to 0.03-0.04 iso ___. He did have nonspecific T wave changes noted on EKG and relief of pain with nitro gtt. However, given that his weight on admission was ~10lbs above his suspected dry weight it was thought that his mild troponin elevation was attributable to volume overload. Patient was weaned off nitro gtt without recurrence of his chest pain. Patient was actively diuresed with IV Lasix before transitioning back to his home 80 mg torsemide PO daily. Of note, patient endorsed a difficult social situation as of late, now facing homelessness, and has spent much of the past year in rehab. He had significant anxiety regarding this as well as worsened depression, which was also felt to be contributory to his presenting symptoms. ACUTE ISSUES:=============# Chest Pain# CAD s/p PCI ___ and CABG ___Patient s/p recent admission on ___ with cardiac cath showing patent LIMA-LAD and SVG-OM grafts. He underwent successful stent placement in the LAD diagonal branch for an 80% occlusion. On presentation this admission, patient endorsed chest pain that was associated with a mild elevation in troponin to 0.03-0.04 associated with nonspecific T wave inversions in the precordial leads. Patient was initially started on a nitro gtt with resolution of his chest pain. The nitro gtt was weaned without recurrence of his pain. It was thought that his mild elevation of troponin was attributable to mild HFmrEF exacerbation as patient was admitted ~10lbs up from his suspected dry weight. For this the patient was actively diuresed with IV Lasix before being transitioned to his home PO torsemide 80 mg. It was also felt that his chest pain was in part attributable to worsened anxiety. Patient noted that he has spent the last year in a rehab facility given recent back and knee surgeries. while there he continued to pay rent without working. He now faces being homeless and his medical comorbidities prevent him from being fit enough to work. This has precipitated acute anxiety and worsening of his depression. Patient was otherwise continued on his home aspirin, statin, carvedilol, lisinopril and spironolactone. # HFmrEFLVEF 43% on ___ echo. Dry weight of 109.5 kg (241.4 lb) at discharge last admission, presented at 251.32 lbs. BNP down from prior admission and CXR clear without obvious evidence of volume overload on exam. He became newly hypoxic (88-89% on RA) after getting NS bolus in ED. Given mild elevation in troponin and elevated weight, patient was diuresed with IV Lasix before being transitioned to his home diuretic of 80 mg PO torsemide. His O2 was weaned and he had no further respiratory distress. Otherwise, his home carvedilol, lisinopril, and spironolactone were continued. ___Cr increased to 1.4. On discharge earlier this month Cr was 1.1 and per review it appears his baseline is ~0.8. Patient was diuresed as above with improvement in Cr to 0.9. # DepressionPatient initially expressed concerns about SI in the ED on presentation. For this he was ___. On the floor, patient denied active thoughts or plans of killing himself, although did endorse passive SI and prior attempt years ago by taking various pills, but patient noted he could not \"bring himself to do it.\" On the floor, patient was not on ___. He did note worsened depression given his recent decline in his health, inability to maintain a job while in his physical condition, and impending homelessness. His home paroxetine was continued. Social work was consulted. Plan for social work at rehab to continue to work with patient to secure resources to be successful once discharged from rehab.

Of note, she denies BRBPR or obvious bleeding. She complains of feeling generalized weakness over the last 1 month with dyspnea on exertion at baseline. She notes chest pain everyday, relieved with daily nitroglycerin use. In the ED, there was discussion of being sent home for monitoring of GI bleed but she developed worsening chest pain with negative troponin and no EKG changes that prompted admission to the floor. Regarding her cardiac history, she underwent PCI on ___ with a complex intervention of the mid LAD s/p DES to the mid LAD and a 2.0 BMS to the distal LAD complicated by a very distal wire dissection. An IABP was placed overnight to aid healing of the dissection. She did well for two months but re-developed typical right sided chest pain in ___. Her cath at that time revealed patent stents and small vessel coronary disease.On the floor, the patient recounts approximately 1 month of symptoms with worsening fatigue, DOE, and angina. She describes her angina as now primarily right sided pressure/pain with radiation to scapula. Interestingly enough, prior to her catheterization her angina was left sided.

      "I am writing to you regarding your recent hospital visit. The main reason for your admission was worsening dyspnea and chest pain for 3 days. You also have a history of CAD, chronic angina, HLD, COPD, and DM. Your medication list includes aspirin, prasugrel, Celebrex, and nitroglycerin, which are all medications that can cause bleeding. Your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were low, and you received a unit of PRBCs in the emergency department.\n",
      "\n",
      "During your hospital stay, you had a discussion of being sent home for monitoring of GI bleed but you developed worsening chest pain with negative troponin and no EKG changes that prompted admission to the floor.

      "Your current symptoms include chest pain, which is now primarily right sided pressure/pain with radiation to the scapula. It is associated with throat tightness and occurs every day, even at rest. You also have a history of worsening fatigue, shortness of breath, and angina, which has been present for approximately 1 month.\n",

      "\n",
      "I would like to discuss your ongoing issues with you. You should consider further workup for iron deficiency anemia, as your discharge hemoglobin level is low. You should not take NSAIDs, including Celebrex, as this can promote further bleeding. Your medication list has been updated to reflect this, and you should discuss alternative agents with your doctor. You have also been prescribed ferrous sulfate, which will help to increase your iron levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would also like to discuss your medication changes. Your medication list includes Isosorbide Mononitrate, which has been increased from 60 to 90 mg daily. This medication is used to treat angina, and the increase in dosage may be necessary to manage your symptoms.\n",

      "Your main reason for admission was pyelonephritis, which is an infection of the kidney. The infection was caused by e.coli bacteria, which was detected in your urine culture. The infection was treated with the antibiotic meropenem, which was started intravenously and will continue for a total of 14 days. You will need to follow up with your primary care physician (pcp) for a weekly blood test to monitor your kidney function and liver function.\n",

      "You also had a ventral hernia repair and panniculectomy, which are surgical procedures to repair abdominal hernias and remove excess skin and fat. Your surgical wound was healing well, but you reported some discomfort with your urostomy bag and when it brushes against your pants. This is a common problem after surgery, and you will need to continue using the urostomy bag and changing it regularly to prevent infection.\n",

      "During your hospital stay, you underwent various diagnostic tests and procedures, including an electrocardiogram (EKG), blood tests, and a urine culture. Your EKG showed signs of heart disease in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, which is a common site for heart attacks. Your blood tests showed a slightly elevated troponin level, which is a marker of heart muscle damage. The urine culture showed a large amount of bacteria, which may have contributed to your recurrent urinary tract infections.\n",

      "The main treatments you received during your hospital stay included aspirin, clopidogrel, nitrofurantoin, and a heparin drip. These medications were prescribed to help prevent blood clots and to treat the bacterial infection. You were also started on a new medication, metoprolol, to help manage your blood pressure and heart rate.\n",

      "Your discharge medications include atorvastatin, clopidogrel, levothyroxine, metoprolol, mirtazapine, vitamin D, nitroglycerin, pantoprazole, Centrum Silver, Detrol LA, Lisinopril, magnesium, melatonin, and aspirin. It is important to take all of these medications as prescribed by your doctor.\n",
