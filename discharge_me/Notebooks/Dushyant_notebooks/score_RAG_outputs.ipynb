The main reason for your admission was to investigate chest pain and shortness of breath that you had been experiencing. After conducting various tests, it was determined that you had a blockage in one of your coronary arteries, which was affecting the blood flow to your heart muscle.\n",

      "\n",
      "Currently, there are no pending results from the tests that were conducted during your hospital stay. However, it is important to note that you will be prescribed new medications to manage your heart condition effectively. These medications will help control your blood pressure, reduce the risk of blood clots, and improve your heart function.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of your follow-up care, it is recommended that you schedule a visit with your cardiologist within the next two weeks. During this appointment, your doctor will assess your recovery progress, review your medications, and discuss any further steps that may be needed to ensure your continued well-being.\n",
