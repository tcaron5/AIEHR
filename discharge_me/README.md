# AIEHR

The objective of this project is to reduce the time and effort clinicians spend on writing detailed notes in the electronic health record (EHR). Clinicians play a crucial role in documenting patient progress in discharge summaries, but the creation of concise yet comprehensive hospital course summaries and discharge instructions often demands a significant amount of time. This can lead to clinician burnout and operational inefficiencies within hospital workflows. By streamlining the generation of these sections, we can not only enhance the accuracy and completeness of clinical documentation but also significantly reduce the time clinicians spend on administrative tasks, ultimately improving patient care quality.
