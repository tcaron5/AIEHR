"target discharge_instructions: Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you! You came to us with 
stomach pain and worsening distension. While you were here we 
did a paracentesis to remove 1.5L of fluid from your belly. We 
also placed you on you 40 mg of Lasix and 50 mg of Aldactone to 
help you urinate the excess fluid still in your belly. As we 
discussed, everyone has a different dose of lasix required to 
make them urinate and it's likely that you weren't taking a high 
enough dose. Please take these medications daily to keep excess 
fluid off and eat a low salt diet. You will follow up with Dr. 
___ in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy 
and EGD scheduled. Of course, we are always here if you need us. 
We wish you all the best!
Your ___ Team.
