The patient's symptoms, medical condition, and other reason for admission were the severe pain caused by the rib fractures, which was difficult to control, and the need for further pain management. The patient's elevated blood pressure, which was 190 mmHg, also contributed to the decision to admit her to the hospital. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes. The reason for admission was to manage her pain and stabilize her condition.\n",

The patient was transferred for trauma surgery evaluation to assess and manage this new symptom. She was admitted to the trauma service and treated for a right nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion. The patient presented with severe, pleuritic right scapula pain limiting her mobility, described as \"severe\". The differential diagnosis included a pneumothorax or hemothorax as a complication of the recent chest tube placement. The diagnostic workup included a chest X-ray or CT scan to assess for any potential complications related to the right hemothorax or lung injury. Laboratory tests such as a complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP) may have been ordered to evaluate for any signs of infection or other systemic complications. The patient received treatments including right chest tube placement, placement of a right pigtail, and medications such as Acetaminophen, Docusate Sodium, Heparin, Morphine SR, Senna, and Polyethylene Glycol. The recommended diagnostic workup includes a computed tomography (CT) scan of the right scapula to evaluate the cause of the severe, pleuritic pain, and a chest X-ray to rule out any potential complications such as a hemothorax or pneumothorax. There are pending results, and the patient is recommended to follow up with a CT scan of the right scapula. The patient received medications related to the medical condition, including pain management with Acetaminophen and Morphine SR, and treatment for constipation with Docusate Sodium and Polyethylene Glycol.\n",
